A JMT hiker decided to use an Ursack for most of the JMT because, ""it was much lighter and pack friendly, a pliable bag made out of military grade spectra, a 'bulletproof' material similar to Kevlar."" The visitor understood that, ""it was not approved for parks like Yosemite because the food could be obtained by the bears by chewing on the fabric even if they didn't tear it open."" When she got to Yosemite, she, ""signed up for a free bear canister loan program, but kept her Ursack in case of overflow items. Anything that didn't fit in the canister at the end of the night would be tied to a tree, not legal with the rangers, but safe from the bears"". She, ""hiked out of Tuolumne Meadows with 3 days of food and most of hers went into the Ursack."" Her and her friend woke up in the night to scratching and saw a sow with cub, ""trying to get into her food bag 80 ft. away. They shouted, shone lights, and threw rocks."" By '30 minutes' into the encounter ""the bears had a hole in the side of the 'bear proof' bag."" Eventually those bears moved on, but before the night was out, two more bears had stopped by to eat the food and garbage still left. The visitor was left with, ""a demolished Ursack and a whole lot of slobbery bear smelling mush."" Additionally, a bear had bitten into the platypus hydration bag. The visitor hiked through to Mammoth Lakes and ""bought a bear canister"" for use on the rest of the trail. When she reported this to Ursack, they were, ""surprised and apologetic about the bag failure and is sending a new, stronger version.",19,50

It sniffed her face, but didn't touch her, then scratched her right thigh seemingly testing out of curiosity which punctured her pants and left two puncture wounds and a raised welt on her thigh. Refused medical response. She told two visitors on the west side of the boardwalk that the bear ""just scratched me"". The couple recorded the incident and we obtained photos of the bear from them. They made noise which startled the bear. It then darted away, ran to the west boardwalk. They made noises and the bear entered the fen vegetation a short distance.

8072,2023-07-08,11:00:00,Yellow Pines Campground,Yellow Pines site A,Yosemite Valley,Improper food storage,"841 tracked Purple 20 to Yellow Pines and discovered a dog at the Climbing Stewards site leashed to a table with dog food and cooking oil next to it. A friend visiting the hosts flagged 841 down to report chasing a bear out of the site minutes before. She was uncertain who's dog it was. She assisted 841 in cleaning up the food after which P20 was tracked to the adjacent campsite (A) standing next to a tent. The bear treed immediately when hazed. A trash can was discovered knocked over adjacent to where the bear was treed. Trash was strewn on the ground including food items. Bear scat was on the ground next to the trash. Further inspection of the site revealed other food/attractants left out including cooking oil, cocoa powder, cinnamon, a coffee urn, cooler with ~30 sodas, and several more trash cans with food items. Additionally, all other food associated with the camp kitchen was stored in a wooden trailer that had 2 side windows approximately 6""x6"" left open with food visible at the screen window. The whole camp kitchen smelled of bacon grease. No one was at the site. 841 called LE for assistance in securing the camp. The bear came out of the tree once LE arrived and 841 chased it further away with paintballs and communicated the food storage issues to V33. While discussing the campsite overall and concerns about the wooden ""food storage trailer"" with LE, some of the campsite occupants returned from climbing. We learned this was a YC group who had received a ""bear talk"" 3 times from: Sandy the camp host, Steven the YC liaison, and Wildlife Management staff the night before. Campers were confused as to why food was left out because the bear message had been reiterated so many times and understood it was unacceptable. They cleaned everything up. Campers informed NPS staff that they were in fact not actually responsible for the kitchen area, but that the ""camp cook"" (Renae and Mark) were hired for the event and in charge of the kitchen area and trailer. After approximately 1 hour at the site from initially chasing the bear, Renae arrived. 841 communicated what happened and expressed concern about continued use of the wooden trailer for food storage after stressing that the camp was left unsecured and the bear obtained food- the first time for this yearling at a campsite so it was just a matter of time before it would return, likely repeatedly, and that bears are designed to pull wood apart, that's how they forage, and that the trailer was not a reasonable or legal way to store food. Renae said that they had been using the trailer for food storage in the park for 20 years and hand never had an issue including last year at the same campsite and even in years where the bears were constantly in camp. V33 was unsure what the compendium stated as ""legal"" food storage. I mentioned I would follow up with my supervisor who had more experience and had been with the program the entirety of the claimed use of the trailer and therefore could verify whether it had ever been ""allowed"". During this conversation, P20 had approached camp again further down so 841 left to again chase the bear. During the time 841 was away from the campsite, V33 cleared the area and 841 talked to 840 who confirmed wooden trailers are pliable material and therefore not a legal way to store food. Since V33 cleared, 841 could not follow up directly on LE's stance, but did notice the bear locker trailer was parked in Yellow Pines and could easily be moved over to unload all the food from the wooden trailer. Upon 841's return to Campsite A, Mark (the man who owned the trailer) had returned and apologized for leaving camp unsecured since it had been his responsibility and he had simply forgot. 841 again explained everything to Mark explaining the plan to unload the food from the wooden trailer into the lockers. Mark was reluctant, again explaining that the trailer had worked for 20 years. 841 reiterated it was not compliant and that giving a bear unlimited access to a wooden trailer full of food (when they went to bed that night), the bear would absolutely gain access and be rewarded again for entering their campsite whereas the lockers would not allow the bear access to the food no matter how long he tried. I also added this bear is very hard to chase. Mark and Renae then mentioned they had an air horn to keep the bear away or offered to sleep in the trailer. 841 reiterated storing food in the lockers and ""guarding"" food is not a legal food storage method for obvious reasons (safety and food rewards for the bear if unable to scare). While talking to Mark, the Climbing Stewards returned to camp (Ethan, Gus, Maria?) and explained the dog leashed in their site was a friend visiting a different employee and were disappointed and upset about the food left out next to the dog. They promised to follow up with the friend. They also asked if I needed help. 841 gave them a quick tutorial on radio telemetry and asked them to locate the bear on the edge of camp if possible and keep him out. 841 ended the conversation with at Mark and Renae felt strongly that the trailer had been used for years without issue and therefore would continue to be OK. They were not disrespectful, just reluctant to change. In fact, Mark helped move the bear locker trailer over to their campsite kitchen area but felt if the wooden trailer would be ""allowed/legal"" that he didn't want to unload all of his food unnecessarily. 841 decided for the time being to leave everything secured in their trailer (doors and windows closed) and to follow up with LE shift supervisor for clarification on the food storage regulations and what would be enforced. The climbing stewards had located the bear high in a tree approximately 50 yards outside of camp toward Southside Drive, the direction the bear had been chased. 841 cleared from the area to try to follow up with LE and touch base with Wildlife Management night shift. 843 and 850 headed back out to Yellow Pines once briefed on the situation. In the 1 hour wildlife staff was absent from Yellow Pines, the bear returned at least 3 times. 841 got clarification from V20 that the wooden trailer does not constitute proper food storage. 841 communicated this to 843 who had already followed up in campsite A and helped them move the majority of their food to the locker trailer (with the exception of 2 large coolers that wouldn't fit). 843 stated the wood siding on the trailer was so old that light was visible filtering from the outside of the trailer in. 843 also believed the trailer to not be bear resistant. While 843 was out tracking the bear, LE also followed up with the site and had the contents of the coolers emptied of food into the food storage lockers. Between the time of the incident (around 11:00) and 20:00 hours, the bear returned no less than 10 times to the boundary of camp including approaching campsites with food out repeatedly in broad daylight. The bear was hazed repeatedly with yelling by campers, yelling and chasing by staff, paintballs, and noise makers. As of late last night, he had retreated to across Southside Drive by the Four Mile Trailhead. There is no question that the food reward obtained in camp changed the behavior of this bear who had previously only been seen on the outskirts of camp foraging naturally.",20,0
